An attempt at a color scheme that does not look like a clown puked up the source
code.

Based on the [[https://github.com/aktersnurra/no-clown-fiesta.nvim][original Neovim theme]] by [[https://github.com/aktersnurra][aktersnurra]]. Converted for Emacs and
extended by ranmaru22.

If you like subtle themes but do want /a little/ color in your life, this is for
you.


** Installation
The theme isn't on MELPA yet, so you have to use the old fashioned way for now.
Clone the repo, copy (or symlink) the ~no-clown-fiesta-theme.el~ into your
~load-path~, and ~(load-theme 'no-clown-fiesta t)~.

Or you can use ~straight.el~.

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package no-clown-fiesta-theme
    :straight
    '(no-clown-fiesta-theme :type git :host github
                            :repo "ranmaru22/no-clown-fiesta-theme.el")
    :config
    (load-theme 'no-clown-fiesta t)
    ;; If you want the treemacs theme as well.
    (no-clown-fiesta-theme-treemacs-enable))
  #+end_src

With Emacs 29, you can also use the new ~package-vc-install~. Make sure to have
~autothemer~ installed as well (=M-x package-install RET autothemer RET=).

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package no-clown-fiesta-theme
    :init
    (unless (package-installed-p 'no-clown-fiesta-theme)
      (package-vc-install "https://github.com/ranmaru22/no-clown-fiesta-theme.el"))
    :config
    (load-theme 'no-clown-fiesta t)
    ;; If you want the treemacs theme as well.
    (no-clown-fiesta-theme-treemacs-enable))
#+end_src

** Treemacs
A treemacs theme is included. It's heavily inspired by the ~doom-atom~ theme
that's part of ~doomemacs/themes~ and is a very minimal monchrome icon theme. In
order to load it, call ~no-clown-fiesta-theme-treemacs-enable~ at any point after
loading the original theme.

** Supported modes
This theme lacks support for many modes because I basically only added support
for those that I personaly use. If you like this theme and want support for a
mode you use that looks bad out of the box, feel free to add some faces to the
file (please respect the palette so everything matches, as well as the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Coding-Conventions.html][ELisp
coding conventions]]) and send a PR.

So far, the following modes are directly supported:

- anzu
- company
- corfu
- consult
- dired
- diredfl
- erc
- flycheck
- flymake
- git-gutter
- highlight-numbers
- isearch
- magit
- orderless
- org-mode
- rainbow-delimiters
- shell / eshell / ansi-colors
- show-paren
- tab-bar
- term / vterm / term-colors
- tree-sitter (builtin + package)
- treemacs
- vertico

Because of tree-sitter, most prog-modes that support it should work nicely out
of the box.
