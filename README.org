An attempt at a color scheme that does not look like a clown puked up the source
code.

Based on the [[https://github.com/aktersnurra/no-clown-fiesta.nvim][original Neovim theme]] by [[https://github.com/aktersnurra][aktersnurra]]. Converted for Emacs and
extended by ranmaru22.

If you like subtle themes but do want /a little/ color in your life, this is for
you.


** Installation
You can install the theme from MELPA, which is the easiest way.

~M-x package-install RET no-clown-fiesta-theme RET~

Or you can use the ~use-package~ macro.

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package no-clown-fiesta-theme
    :config
    (load-theme 'no-clown-fiesta t))
  #+end_src

** Supported modes
This theme lacks support for many modes because I basically only added support
for those that I personaly use. If you like this theme and want support for a
mode you use that looks bad out of the box, feel free to add some faces to the
file (please respect the palette so everything matches, as well as the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Coding-Conventions.html][ELisp
coding conventions]]) and send a PR.

So far, the following modes are directly supported:

- anzu
- company
- corfu
- consult
- dired
- diredfl
- erc
- flycheck
- flymake
- git-gutter
- highlight-numbers
- isearch
- magit
- orderless
- org-mode
- rainbow-delimiters
- shell / eshell / ansi-colors
- show-paren
- tab-bar
- term / vterm / term-colors
- tree-sitter (builtin + package)
- treemacs
- vertico

Because of tree-sitter, most prog-modes that support it should work nicely out
of the box.
